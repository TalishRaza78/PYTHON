## 📖 What is Python?

**Python** is a high-level, interpreted programming language created by **Guido van Rossum** and released in **1991**. It emphasizes readability, simplicity, and flexibility, making it popular for both beginners and professionals.

Python supports multiple programming paradigms including object-oriented, procedural, and functional programming.

## 🚀 Features of Python

- Clean and readable syntax
- Interpreted (no need to compile)
- Dynamically typed
- Extensive standard library
- Cross-platform compatibility
- Large community and support
- Great for web development, data science, machine learning, scripting, and more

## 💡 What Can You Build With Python?

- Web applications (e.g. Django, Flask)
- Data analysis and visualization (e.g. Pandas, Matplotlib)
- Machine learning and AI (e.g. TensorFlow, scikit-learn)
- Scripting and automation
- Desktop applications
- Games and simulations
- Internet of Things (IoT) and robotics
- APIs and backend services

## 💻 Python Installation

To run Python code, you need to have Python installed on your system. Follow the steps below to install Python.

### ✅ Step 1: Download Python

Visit the official Python website: [https://www.python.org/downloads/](https://www.python.org/downloads/)

Choose the appropriate installer for your operating system:

- **Windows**: Download the `.exe` installer
- **macOS**: Download the `.pkg` installer
- **Linux**: Use your system's package manager (see below)

---

### 🪟 Windows

# 📘 Python Data Types: Strings, Lists, and Tuples

This document provides an overview of three core data types in Python: **Strings**, **Lists**, and **Tuples**.

---

## 🔤 Strings (`str`)

Strings are **immutable** sequences of characters used to represent text.

### ✅ Declaration
```python
name = "Alice"
greeting = 'Hello, world!'
multiline = """This is
a multiline string."""
```

## 📋 Lists (`list`)

Lists are **mutable**, ordered collections that can store multiple items, including different data types. Lists are one of the most commonly used data structures in Python.

---

### ✅ Declaration

You can create a list using square brackets `[]`:

```python
fruits = ["apple", "banana", "cherry"]
numbers = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
mixed = ["hello", 42, 3.14, True]
empty = []

```
## 📦 Tuples (`tuple`)

Tuples are **immutable**, ordered collections in Python. They are used to store a fixed set of values that should not be changed during the execution of a program.

---

### ✅ Declaration

You can create a tuple using parentheses `()`:

```python
colors = ("red", "green", "blue")
numbers = (1, 2, 3, 4)
mixed = ("hello", 42, True, 3.14)

# Single-item tuple (note the trailing comma)
single = ("one",)

```

## 🔍 Differences at a Glance

| Feature   | String        | List | Tuple         |
| --------- | ------------- | ---- | ------------- |
| Ordered   | ✅             | ✅    | ✅             |
| Mutable   | ❌ (immutable) | ✅    | ❌ (immutable) |
| Indexable | ✅             | ✅    | ✅             |
| Iterable  | ✅             | ✅    | ✅             |

# Python Dictionary

A **dictionary** in Python is an unordered collection of key-value pairs. It is used to store data values where each value is accessed by a unique key.

## Syntax

```python
my_dict = {
    "name": "Alice",
    "age": 30,
    "city": "New York"
}
